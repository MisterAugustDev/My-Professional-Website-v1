# My Professional Website
 I am creating this website as my first front-end experience.

THIS WEBSITE IS STILL IN PROGRESS.
I recently started my front-end studies and will take a little while
to finish this project. Any visitor can come and check out my progress
every month. My dev teacher is Gustavo Guanabara and his You Tube channel
is "Curso em VÃ­deo". All classes in Portuguese.
Thanks for reading. Your dearest weirdo Mister August.
