I recently started my front-end studies and will take a little while
to finish this project. Any visitor can come and check out my progress
every month. My dev teacher is Gustavo Guanabara and his You Tube channel
is "Curso em VÃ­deo". All classes in Portuguese. -->

     and other div with the greeting text and the three buttons "LinkedIn", "Github" and "Contact me." -->

    <!-- PART 4: Four sections showing four of my projects, each one with a picture and a short
